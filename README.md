Created originally in Flash, as part of a technical test.

I have since used it as a testbed for learning other web technology related languages by porting this codebase to them.

So far been ported to the following languages.

- [Dart][dart] ([StageXL][stagexl])
- [TypeScript][typescript] ([OpenFL][openfl])

[dart]:       https://dart.dev/
[stagexl]:    http://www.stagexl.org/
[typescript]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/
[openfl]:     https://www.openfl.org/
